# ModengTerm - A modern terminal emulator developed using WPF

ModengTerm is a terminal emulator developed using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). It draws inspiration from the best features of other leading terminal software and innovates by incorporating user feedback and needs. Our goal is to provide users with a terminal experience that is both familiar and uniquely distinctive.

All core modules of ModengTerm, including the parser, terminal engine, and rendering engine, are developed in-house. This approach grants us exceptional customization capabilities, allowing the terminal to be finely tuned to meet user requirements. However, it also results in a more complex codebase. Despite this complexity, we are committed to meticulous design and optimization to ensure optimal performance and an outstanding user experience.

Through continuous innovation and technological advancements, ModengTerm aims to become a powerful, stable, and easily extensible terminal emulator that meets the diverse needs of both professional developers and everyday users.

## Main Features

1. **Multi-Protocol Support**:
   - ModengTerm supports interactions with SSH servers, serial ports, and the Windows command line. This versatility makes it an indispensable tool for users working in diverse operating systems and environments.

2. **Session Management**:
   - Users can save session configurations, including connection details and settings, allowing for rapid reconnection. This feature streamlines workflows and boosts productivity by reducing setup time.

3. **Content Export and Search**:
   - Terminal output can be exported in both TXT and HTML formats, providing flexibility in how users archive and share information. The ability to search through historical records using keywords or regular expressions enhances the efficiency of information retrieval and management.

4. **Synchronized Input Across Multiple Terminals**:
   - This feature enables users to input commands simultaneously across multiple open terminal sessions, which is particularly useful for managing multiple remote servers or executing the same commands on different systems.

5. **Customization Options**:
   - ModengTerm offers extensive customization options, including color themes and interface layouts, allowing users to tailor the terminal to their preferences and workflow requirements. This ensures that each user can create an environment that best suits their needs.

6. **Automatic Log Recording**:
   - The system automatically records all user activities, providing a detailed log of operations. This feature is crucial for tracking and auditing actions, especially in development and security-sensitive environments where accountability is paramount.

By incorporating these features, ModengTerm aims to provide a robust, flexible, and user-friendly terminal emulator that meets the diverse needs of both professional developers and everyday users.
